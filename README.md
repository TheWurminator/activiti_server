COP4331 Group Project for Spring 2016 at UCF

ActivitI is an application which allows people to meet each other through activitIs or meetups.

This is the server side portion of the application which listens for https requests in order to process them, query the database and send back a response to the application. Using a RESTful API, this web server which is implemented in nodejs can communicate with any platform acting as a front end for the ActivitI service.
